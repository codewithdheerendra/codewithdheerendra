### 👋 Hi, I'm Dheerendra

I'm a passionate full-stack developer with 2+ years of experience, specializing in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), along with strong skills in **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL**.

I’ve worked on multiple real-world projects—both in professional and freelance capacities—where the solutions I built are actively used by business owners. While some of these projects are not open-source, they represent my ability to deliver scalable and production-ready software from scratch.
